## About Me
  I have worked as a department chief for over 5 years in a company developing accounting software. We are engaged in the development of software for payroll and HR administration both for individual projects (taking into account the specifics of customers) and independent software that could be used by any organization. My team has more than 15 successful implemented projects.

  Now I decided to try something new. Why did I choose front-end development? It is important for me to see the result of my work.

  I believe that my strengths: ability to work in a team, responsibility, diligence, stress resistance, â€” will allow me to succeed in the new path of my life.

      arr2.sort();
